##Java Syntax

1. Rectangle Area - Write a program that enters the **sides of a rectangle** (two integers **a** and **b**) and calculates and prints the rectangle's area.

2. Triangle Area - Write a program that enters 3 points in the plane (as integer **x** and **y** coordinates), calculates and prints the **area of the triangle** composed by these 3 points. Round the result to a whole number. In case the three points do not form a triangle, print "**0**" as result. This resource could help you: http://www.mathopenref.com/coordtrianglearea.html.

3. Points inside a Figure - Write a program to check whether a point is **inside or outside of the figure** below. The point is given as a pair of floating-point numbers, separated by a space. Your program should print "Inside" or "Outside".

4. The Smallest of 3 Numbers - Write a program that finds the **smallest of three numbers**.

5. Decimal to Hexadecimal - Write a program that enters a positive integer number **num** and converts and prints it in hexadecimal form. You may use some built-in method from the standard Java libraries.

6. Formatting Numbers - Write a program that reads 3 numbers: an integer **a** (0 ≤ **a** ≤ 500), a floating-point **b** and a floating-point **c** and **prints them in 4 virtual columns** on the console. Each column should have a width of 10 characters. The number **a** should be printed in **hexadecimal, left aligned**; then the number **a** should be printed in **binary form, padded with zeroes**, then the number **b** should be **printed with 2 digits after the decimal point, right aligned**; the number **c** should be **printed with 3 digits after the decimal point, left aligned**.

7. Count of Bits One - Write a program to **calculate the count of bits 1** in the binary representation of given integer number **n**.

8. Count of Equal Bit Pairs - Write a program to count **how many sequences of two equal bits** ("**00**" or "**11**") can be found in the binary representation of given integer number **n** (with overlapping).

9. Points inside the House - Write a program to check whether a point is **inside or outside the house** below. The point is given as a pair of floating-point numbers, separated by a space. Your program should print "Inside" or "Outside".
