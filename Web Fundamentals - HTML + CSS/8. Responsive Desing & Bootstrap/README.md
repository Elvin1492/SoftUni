Make the site responsive with the following steps:
    *   From 780px to 960px – white spaces disappear, the section and sidebars scale proportionally with the browser window (see the following PNG file: “01-Unresponsive-Homework-02-780-960.png”).
    *   From 640px to 780px – The sidebar moves to the bottom of the page and the items are situated next to each other (see the following PNG file: “01-Unresponsive-Homework-03-640-780.png”).
    *   Under  640px – The menu changes again, the header falls under the logo and they are centered, the items in the sidebar (below the section now) are arranged in new way (see the following PNG file: “01-Unresponsive-Homework-04-Under-640.png”).
