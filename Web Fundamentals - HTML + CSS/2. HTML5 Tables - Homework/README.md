## 4. Website Header
Create a Web page header that looks like the picture below (100% accuracy is not required). Use tables to achieve the layout. Use list for the menu. Use text input field and button for the search. Link the SoftUni logo with https://softuni.bg. The menu buttons must work (open some URL). Making the menu with a dropdown functionality is optional. You don't need to implement the same styles as the example.
