## Introduction to Programming

1. Play with Visual Studio - Familiarize yourself with Microsoft Visual Studio (if you already have it installed) or install Visual Studio (or 
Start Visual Studio and play with it. Create a simple C# program (console application), compile and run it.

* Blank Solution in Visual Studio - Create a blank solution in Visual Studio called "Intro-Programming-Homework". This solution will hold all your homework projects, code and files. For each problem (exercises) add a separate project with self-descriptive name like "Hello-World" and "Print-Your-Name".

* Play with MSDN Library - Play with Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) Library Documentation. You may find it online at http://msdn.microsoft.com/library.
	* Find information about `Console.WriteLine()` method in MSDN.
	* Find information about the **Console** class.
	* Find information about the **class** keyword.

* Hello World - Create, compile and run a **"Hello C#" console application.** Ensure you have named the application well (e.g. **HelloCSharp).**

* Print Your Name - Modify the previous application **to print your name.** Ensure you have named the application well (e.g. **PrintMyName).**

* Print Numbers - Write a program to print the numbers **1, 101 and 1001**, each at a separate line.

* Print First and Last Name - Create console application that **prints your first and last name**, each at a separate line.

* Square Root - Create a console application that calculates and prints the **square root** of the number 12345.

* Print a Sequence - Write a program that prints the **first 10 members** of the sequence: **2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, ...**

* Reformat C# Code - Reformat the following C# code **to make it readable according to the C# best practices for code formatting.** Change the casing of the identifiers in the code (e.g. use PascalCase for the class name)

* Programming Languages - Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with information about the most popular programming languages. How similar are they to C#? How do they differ from C#?

* Development Environments - Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide a short list with popular development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.

* C# and .NET Differences - Describe the difference between C# and .NET Framework in 2-3 sentences.

* Current Date and Time - Create a console application that prints the **current date and time.**

* Age after 10 Years - Write a program to read your birthday from the console and print how old you are now and how old you will be after 10 years.

* Print Long Sequence - Write a program that prints the **first 1000 members of the sequence: 2, -3, 4, -5, 6, -7, ....**
