##Loops

1. Numbers from 1 to N - Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer **n** and **prints all the numbers from 1 to n**, on a single line, separated by a space.

2. Numbers Not Divisible by 3 and 7 - Write a program that enters from the console a positive integer **n** and prints all the **numbers from 1 to n not divisible by 3 and 7**, on a single line, separated by a space.

3. Min, Max, Sum and Average of N Numbers - Write a program that reads from the console a sequence of **n** integer numbers and returns the **minimal**, the **maximal** number, the sum and **the average of all numbers** (displayed with 2 digits after the decimal point). The **input** starts by the number **n** (alone in a line) followed by **n lines**, each holding an integer number.

4. Print a Deck of 52 Cards - Write a program that generates and prints **all possible cards from a standard deck of 52 cards** (without the jokers). The cards should be printed using the classical notation (**like 5♠, A♥, 9♣ and K♦**). The card faces should start from 2 to A. Print each card face in its four possible suits: clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades. Use 2 nested **for-loops** and a **switch-case** statement.

5. Calculate 1 + 1!/X + 2!/X2 + … + N!/XN - Write a program that, for a given two integer numbers **n** and **x**, calculates the sum **S = 1 + 1!/x + 2!/x2 + … + n!/xn**. Use only one loop. Print the result with 5 digits after the decimal point.

6. Calculate N! / K! - Write a program that calculates **n! / k!** for given **n** and **k** (**1 < k < n < 100**). Use only one loop.

7. Calculate N! / (K! * (N-K)!) - In combinatorics, the number of ways to choose **k** different members out of a group of **n** different elements (also known as the number of combinations) is calculated by the following formula: **n! / (k! * (n-k)!)** for given **n** and **k** (**1 < k < n < 100**).

8. Catalan Numbers - Write a program to calculate the **n-th [Catalan number](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_number)** by given **n** (1 < n < 100).

9. Matrix of Numbers - Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number **n** (1 ≤ n ≤ 20) and **prints a matrix** like in the examples below. Use two nested loops.

10. Odd and Even Product - You are given **n** integers (given in a single line, separated by a space). Write a program that checks whether the product of the odd elements is equal to the product of the even elements. Elements are counted from **1 to n**, so the first element is odd, the second is even.

11. Random Numbers in Given Range - Write a program that enters 3 integers **n**, **min** and **max** (**min ≤ max**) and prints n random numbers in the range [**min...max]**.

12. Randomize the Numbers 1…N - Write a program that enters in integer **n** and prints the numbers 1, 2, …, **n** in random order.

13. Binary to Decimal Number - Using loops write a program that converts a **binary integer number to its decimal form**. The input is entered as **string**. The output should be a variable of type **long**. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.

14. Decimal to Binary Number - Using loops write a program that converts an **integer number to its binary representation**. The input is entered as **long**. The output should be a variable of type **string**. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.

15. Hexadecimal to Decimal Number - Using loops write a program that converts a **hexadecimal integer number to its decimal form**. The input is entered as **string**. The output should be a variable of type **long**. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.

16. Decimal to Hexadecimal Number - Using loops write a program that converts an **integer number to its hexadecimal representation**. The input is entered as **long**. The output should be a variable of type **string**. Do not use the built-in .NET functionality.

17. Calculate GCD - Write a program that calculates the [greatest common divisor (GCD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of given two integers **a** and **b**. Use the **Euclidean algorithm**.

18. Trailing Zeroes in N! - Write a program that calculates with how many zeroes the factorial of a given number **n** has at its end. Your program should work well for very big numbers, e.g. n=100000.

19. Spiral Matrix - Write a program that reads from the console a positive integer number **n (1 ≤ n ≤ 20)** and **prints a matrix** holding the numbers from **1 to n*n** in the form of **square spiral**.
