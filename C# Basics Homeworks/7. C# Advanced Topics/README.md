﻿Homework: C# Advanced Topics

1. Fibonacci Numbers - Define a method Fib(n) that calculates the nth Fibonacci number.

2. Prime Checker - Write a Boolean method IsPrime(n) that check whether a given integer number n is prime.

3. Primes in Given Range - Write a method that calculates all prime numbers in given range and returns them as list of integers.

4. Difference between Dates - Write a program that enters two dates in format dd.MM.yyyy and returns the number of days between them.

5. Sorting Numbers - Write a program that reads a number n and a sequence of n integers, sorts them and prints them.

6. Longest Area in Array - Write a program to find the longest area of equal elements in array of strings. You first should read an integer n and n strings (each at a separate line), then find and print the longest sequence of equal elements (first its length, then its elements). If multiple sequences have the same maximal length, print the leftmost of them.

7. Matrix of Palindromes - Write a program to generate the following matrix of palindromes of 3 letters with r rows and c columns. 

8. Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence - Write a program that reads a sequence of integers and finds in it the longest non-decreasing subsequence. In other words, you should remove a minimal number of numbers from the starting sequence, so that the resulting sequence is non-decreasing. In case of several longest non-decreasing sequences, print the leftmost of them. The input and output should consist of a single line, holding integer numbers separated by a space.

9. Remove Names - Write a program that takes as input two lists of names and removes from the first list all names given in the second list. The input and output lists are given as words, separated by a space, each list at a separate line.

10. Join Lists - Write a program that takes as input two lists of integers and joins them. The result should hold all numbers from the first list, and all numbers from the second list, without repeating numbers, and arranged in increasing order. The input and output lists are given as integers, separated by a space, each list at a separate line.

11. Count of Letters - Write a program that reads a list of letters and prints for each letter how many times it appears in the list. The letters should be listed in alphabetical order. Use the input and output format from the examples below.

12. Count of Names - Write a program that reads a list of names and prints for each name how many times it appears in the list. The names should be listed in alphabetical order. Use the input and output format from the examples below.

13. Average Load Time Calculator - We have a report that holds dates, web site URLs and load times (in seconds) in the same format like in the examples below. Your tasks is to calculate the average load time for each URL. Print the URLs in the same order as they first appear in the input report. Print the output in the format given below. Use double floating-point precision.

14. Longest Word in a Text - Write a program to find the longest word in a text.

15. Extract URLs from Text - Write a program that extracts and prints all URLs from given text. URL can be in only two formats:
http://something, e.g. http://softuni.bg, http://forums.softuni.bg, http://www.nakov.com OR www.something.domain, e.g. www.nakov.com, www.softuni.bg, www.google.com

16*. Counting a Word in a Text - Write a program that counts how many times a given word occurs in given text. The first line in the input holds the word. The second line of the input holds the text. The output should be a single integer number – the number of word occurrences. Matching should be case-insensitive. Note that not all matching substrings are words and should be counted. A word is a sequence of letters separated by punctuation or start / end of text.
